Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-India
==============================

The project has been developed using TensorFlow to detect the License Plates (specifically trained on Indian car dataset) from a car and uses the Tesseract Engine to recognize the charactes from the detected plate.

Software Packages Needed
- Anaconda 3 (Tool comes with most of the required python packages along with python3)
- Tesseract Engine (Must need to be installed)

Python Packages Needed
- Tensorflow
- openCV
- pytesseract


## Method

1. Detect License Plate
2. Perform segmentation of characters
3. Train a ML model to predict characters
4. Prediction of characters in License Plate

## Instructions

- Run these scripts to clone the repository, install dependencies and train the detectors.

```
!git clone https://github.com/udaylunawat/Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition.git
%cd Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition/

# Running shell script on colab
!bash conda_create_environment.sh
!bash train.sh
```
- Run this script and pass image as cli to get result

```
python plate_to_text/py car.jpg
